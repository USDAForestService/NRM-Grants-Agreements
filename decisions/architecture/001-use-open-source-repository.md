# 1. Use an open-source repository

Status: accepted (retrospect) \
Date: [28 April 2021](https://github.com/USDAForestService/NRM-Grants-Agreements/issues/141#event-4657973222)

## Decision Outcome

We decided to use an open-source GitHub code repository for the NRM G&A modernization.

### Positive Consequences

- Enacts the principle of doing public work in public.
- Keeps the repository under Forest Service control (while staying open).
- Aligns with the 18F [policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md) of working in the open. See the policy for more on the benefits of working in the open.
- Aligns with long-standing 18F [practice](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/open-source/) of working in the open.
- Facilitates access to the repository for new team members and avoids a costly wait for USDA onboarding.
- Avoids all costs associated with cloud-hosted CI/CD platforms such as CircleCI and GitHub Actions.

### Negative Consequences
